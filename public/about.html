<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineer and I've been working at Altair Engineering for the past 6 years. In the company I've taken several roles, from intern to solution specialist.</p>

<p>As an intern my focus was mainly on documentation. How to improve SimLab's (one of Altair's product) help page. During my 1y6mo intership I've managed to create hundreds of tutorials, for which I developed a website for people to watch them. I didn't have any programming knowledge at the beggining, but I had a goal in mind. To create the website, I had to learn .html, .css and .js, at least the basics. My first webpage looked awesome to me. It was a table of content, mainly, but served well it's purpose. </p>

<p>After graduating, I've been hired at Altair. I continued the tutorial creation and enhanced the website. After achieving hundreds of thousands of access, my website became a reference inside the company, inspiring several other teams. All the knowledge obtained during the process made me a specialist not only in SimLab but also in video editing. I've given several trainings in both things at this point. I'm always thinking about the next steps, and I feel it is time to develop a new and more improved learning center. This is my objective for attending a full-stack web developer course.</p>
