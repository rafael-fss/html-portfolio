<h1>The Best Videogames According to Rafael</h1>
<h2>My top 3 videogames of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The legend of zelda: Breath of the wild / Tiers of the kingdom</h3>
<p>These has been the best adventure experience I've ever had in a videogame.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact / Honkai Star Rail</h3>
<p>These are mobile games, both from the same publisher. One is an adventure and the other a turn-based rpg</p>
<h3>Pokemon Franchise</h3>
<p>I generally enjoy the genre, but pokemon games are the best in my opinion.</p>
